# mini_project_data_adhira_riyanti_amanda

Mini project for Data Engineering Program At Alterra Academy. This project requires us to create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and data visualizations

### ETL Pipeline

- #### Data Ingestion
    Extract data from many source (CSV, json, database, XML, API)
    Ingested Dataset:
    -   Percentage of electricity access in various countries
    -   Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries
    -   Population of countries from various sources (CSV, JSON, database, XML, API)
    -   Projects that have been or are being carried out by the World Bank
    -   Percentage of rural population in various countries

- #### Data Transformation

    - Combining data
    - Data cleaning
        - Handling Missing Data
        - Removing Duplicate Data
    - Changing data types
    - Outliers removal
    - Scaling features
    - Feature engineering

- #### Data Load
    Load data into Google Cloud Storage Bucket

### Data Visualization

Data visualization using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries in Python
